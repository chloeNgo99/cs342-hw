Add your problem 4 answer here:
After watching the video, I learned that the quality of code is very important.
Even though code is a language of computer, writing code is also similar like writing
an easy. Clean code makes it easy to read, understand, and implement changes.
Nobody wants to read a block of code and have to spend hours just to understand what
it means. Nevertheless, poor code quality can lead to many consequences such as a
development speed decrease, harder to debug, or making the production cost increase
over time.
