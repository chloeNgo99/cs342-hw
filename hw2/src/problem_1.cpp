/*
 *When I was a kid, I had a little piggy bank where I can save my pocket money every day,
 * and I would break it whenever it was full or at the end of every year.
 * Growing up, I get introduced to the concept of compound interest, but I was not very
 * interested in learning the mechanism behind it. Though, I couldnâ€™t imagine that one that
 * I would have to write an algorithm that computes the compound interest. Since it brought to
 * my attention how much money I can save with just a little investment.
 * This encouraged me to start investing early since compound interest works best over a
 * long period of time. Spent money less on unnecessary things, use it as a daily or monthly
 * contribution and avoid having an outstanding debt for the rest of my career life.
