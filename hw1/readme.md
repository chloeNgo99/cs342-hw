## Spring into Action

### Dates

    - Assigned: 03/30/2022
    - Due: Monday Apr 11 23:59:00 PST 2022

## Goals ##

- C++ programming basics.
- Write your own tests.
- Get familiar with Git and Github ([Great tuturial from Harvard's CS50](https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A))
- Get comfortable with the grading submission process.

### Problems To Solve

There are **THREE** problems to solve. Please find the description of the first 2 problem in their own page:

- [Problem 1](problem_1.md) (30pt)
- [Problem 2](problem_2.md) (30pt)
- [Problem 3](problem_3.md) (30pt)
- Problem 4 has 10 point as following: Send me a private message in Discord. Describe the following:
  - Your full name.
  - Your technical background. For example, what programming language do you know and how well? Have you used C++ before? If yes, on what kind of projects? What's the biggest challenge in those projects?
  - How much do you know/remember about data structures such as array, list, tree, graph?
  - How much do you konw/remember about algorithms such as sorting, searching and recursion?
  - What do you like/dislike about programming?
  - What do you struggle the most when learning programming?
  - Feeling of the class so far and suggestions. Is it too fast? Too slow? Lecture too long? My accent hard to understand? Need more explanation on topics? 

### Code Correctness ###

Your code is as correct as what the Github PR tests prove, and looks for the double green check marks as below in PR grader bot result. It means the PR is good enough for submission, but it doesn't mean there's no more room to improve.

### Code Repo ###

Use the following repo for homework:

**Code:** https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/2022-342-sprint-1 

Not using this repo will result in 0 point.

General requirements (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Do not create any new file or delete existing file in the repo. The grader bot checks for this.
- Do not make modification to any file outside the ***src*** and ***test*** folders.
- Do not make modification to any file unless specificially allowed (in comments or told by the instructor).

### Work Instruction
Follow [this guide](https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/CSS342A-2022-Spring/blob/main/homeworks/work_guide.md).

### Notes ###

- Start early. Be active. Ask questions.
- Partial credits will be given. If you cannot finish some part, add comments describing your thinking.
- OK to search web for help. Give credits in your code if you use any.
- Homework is to be done by yourself. Okay to discuss with others. 
- Late submission without explanation AND permission will receive **ZERO** point.  
- Read grader and teacher's code review comments. Be open to accept them for improvement but be prepared to defend your choice. 

### Code of Conduct

Plagarism will not be tolerated and will receive **ZERO** point, this includes (but not limited to)

- Copy others' code line by line.
- Copy online resources line by line, with or without giving credits.

Offense will be reported to the department.

I will not be able to catch all the cheats and frankly it could hurt nobody but yourself. Here's some reason why [you shouldn't cheat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMloyp6NI4E).
