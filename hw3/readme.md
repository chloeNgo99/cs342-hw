## "Spring Yet?"

### Dates

    - Assigned: 04/29/2022
    - Due: Monday May 08 23:59:00 PDT 2022

## Goals ##

- C++: programming OOP
- ADT: ArrayList and LinkedList 
- Use given unit tests as instruction manual

### Problems To Solve

There are **Three** problems to solve:

- [Problem 1](problem_1.md) (45pt)
- [Problem 2](problem_2.md) (45pt)
- [Problem 3](problem_3.md) (10pt)


### Code Repo ###

Use the following repo for homework:

**Code:** https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/2022-342-sprint-3 

Not using this repo will result in 0 point.

General requirements (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Do not create any new file or delete existing file in the repo. The grader bot checks for this.
- Do not make modification to any file outside the ***src*** and ***test*** folders.
- Do not make modification to any file unless specificially allowed (in comments or told by the instructor).

### Work Instruction
Follow [this guide](https://github.com/a-teaching-goose/CSS342A-2022-Spring/blob/main/homeworks/work_guide.md).

### Notes ###

- Start early. Be active. Ask questions.
- Partial credits will be given. If you cannot finish some part, add comments describing your thinking.
- OK to search web for help. Give credits in your code if you use any.
- Homework is to be done by yourself. Okay to discuss with others. 
- Late submission without explanation AND permission will receive **ZERO** point.  
- Read grader and teacher's code review comments. Be open to accept them for improvement but be prepared to defend your choice. 

### Code of Conduct

Plagarism will not be tolerated and will receive **ZERO** point, this includes (but not limited to)

- Copy others' code line by line.
- Copy online resources line by line, with or without giving credits.

Offense will be reported to the department.

I will not be able to catch all the cheats and frankly it could hurt nobody but yourself. Here's some reason why [you shouldn't cheat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMloyp6NI4E).
