## (10pt) Video Watch

In this task, we have two youtube videos to watch and learn:

1. [Trading Psychology: How to Handle FOMO (Dr. Steenbarger)](https://youtu.be/bEXz7Abf-wM), hint: replace "trading" or "trader" with "programming" related
2. [TDD for those who don't need it](https://youtu.be/a6oP24CSdUg)


Please write down at least one paragraph about what you learn from each video in the code repo test/problem_3.md.
