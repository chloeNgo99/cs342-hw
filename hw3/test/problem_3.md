From the first video, I learned that FOMO is an anxiety fear of missing out.
And I think this happened even on a regular basis. People fear and worry about
a lot of things in their life such as money, school, jobs, health, etc. 
And the key to overcoming fear is having a strong motivation and aiming for 
greater goals. As Dr. Steenbarger mentioned, people who often think about 
making quick bucks don’t last long in the business. And the people who succeed
in business always aim for a higher goal and continue acquiring new knowledge.
It’s a journey of growing and learning from our past mistakes. There are 
several strategies to deal with fear and anxiety such as exposure which is 
basically about training ourselves how to relax. The next strategy is changing
thinking. The idea of this stage is to analyze or understand the fear, and 
consequences and create responses. The third strategy to avoid fear is called
broaden and build, which dealing with work-life balance. In conclusion, I think
it’s absolutely normal to be fearful about something or unsure about ourselves.
But at the end of the day, we need to put our faith and trust in the process 
and focus on self-improvement.

After watching this video, I do not understand what is the main point the guy was 
proposing but I definitely agree with him. He makes a good solid point about focusing 
on getting the code done rather than talking about the benefit of TDD. However, it starts 
to make me wonder what is it about TDD that makes people don’t like it. When I did some 
research, I found out that most people who have problems with TDD are usually related to 
time-consuming, unrealistic expectations, and waste of time. Though, it’s important to note 
that we should not expect TDD to solve all the problems. Instead, TDD emphasizes the effective 
and sustainable testing approach and contributes directly to the software quality in general.
